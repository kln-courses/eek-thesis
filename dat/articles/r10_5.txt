In the last part of this series of articles, we provided a glimpse at the history and the origin of the religion of the Rafidah on the basis of the false theory of “al-imamah al-ilahiyyah” (the divine imamah), and the theories derived from it, such as “wasiyyah” (inherited authority), “nass” (verbatim appointment), “taqiyyah” (concealing the truth out of fear), “bada” (occurrence of an idea), “ghaybah” (prolonged absence), “raj’ah” (reincarnation), and other kufri innovations and superstitions. And we shall attempt in this series – by Allah’s permission – to explain how the Rafidah were compelled to play with the theory of al-imamah al-ilahiyyah, which they made a condition for the establishment of the Islamic State, and how they added modification after modification upon that until they arrived at the theory of “wilayat al-faqih” (the leadership of the jurist), which abrogated the foundations of their original theories, and which the shirki Iranian state is founded upon today, and which they seek to spread throughout all the Muslim lands. In contrast to the claims of the Rafidah that their religion is revelation from the heavens upon Allah’s Messenger, Muhammad g, and that it reached them in stages by way of ‘Ali Ibn Abi Talib  and his sons, and which they even wrote down on sheets of paper and propagated amongst the people, most researchers and examiners conclude that this religion was written by the scholars of the Rafidah after the death of all those to whom they ascribe imamah and infallibility from among the sons of ‘Ali , and their entering into what they call “the era of ghaybah,” meaning the absence of their 12th imam, whom they invented due to his nonexistence, so that they could thereby patch up their torn garment and reinforce their ruined building. But the Rafidah were not content with stipulating infallibility and nass for the position of imamah, which they used as a pretext to claim the illegitimacy of all of the khulafa of Allah’s Messenger g, beginning with Abu Bakr as-Siddiq , and to justify rebelling against them and making takfir of them. Rather, they even turned to the general Muslim masses and stipulated on them matters concerning their religion, requiring them to give bay’ah to their imams and enter into their rejectionist religion in order for them to be Muslim. From the most important things they began with was the issue of imamah. They thereby made it a principle from the principles of religion, such that those who didn’t know the imam of their time and give him bay’ah had no iman, and because of this, dispute occurred between them concerning the iman of some of the leading companions of their imams when they died during the period in which there was dispute in designating the imam. And what restricted the followers of their religion even more was their saying that everything connected to the position of imamah comes to a halt, including rulings such as judgment and the carrying out of hudud, hisbah, jihad, Jumu’ah, and other than that, for it would not be correct to carry out these things except for the one who is claimed to be the imam or the one whom the imam appoints for that, and they forbade them from seeking judgment from those whom they refer to as “the imams of tyranny,” and from fighting behind them, and from praying Jumu’ah behind them, and from giving them their zakah. Their deviation even reached the point of legislating in the religion, so they forbade their followers from taking directly from the Book of Allah, or the Sunnah of the Allah’s Messenger g, and obligated that they take rulings strictly from the imams, and they claimed that the speech of their imams was “the speaking Quran,” contrary to what they called “the silent Quran,” which was in the books and the breasts of the Muslims. Then, the matter went even further as they opposed the ceasing of legislation in the religion with the death of the Prophet g, claiming that he specifically delegated his household with legislating many of the rulings that didn’t occur in his lifetime and therefore didn’t require that he speak on them, and that everything ascribed to their imams of words and deeds was in fact what they had inherited from the knowledge of prophethood. Rather, they digressed even further after that and claimed that their imams receive revelation from Allah c, making their words divine revelation which they include in what they call “sunnah” in usul al-fiqh, so they forbade ijtihad in the religion, and they considered anyone apart from the imams who took it upon himself to give fatwas to be from the tawaghit who legislate and judge by other than the Book of Allah. And they didn’t stop at restricting the tafsir of the Quran and the Sunnah to what is attributed to their imams of statements, nor at explaining the two revealed texts with hidden interpretations. Rather, their wretched tongues extended to the point of belying and distorting the text itself, such that there was no authentic narration in the Sunnah except that which agreed with their madhhab, built upon a statement falsely attributed to Ja’far as-Sadiq: “Whoever opposes the masses then he is guided,” and what they mean by the masses is Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jama’ah. They even denied the authenticity of the Quran, claiming that the companions of Allah’s Messenger g distorted its verses, and removed from the clear text that used to be inside it mentioning the imamah of ‘Ali  and his household, while also claiming that they took away what was inside it of the cursing of Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, and Bani Umayyah, and everything else that isn’t in their false madhhab and kufri religion. They then ascribed to their imams a mushaf other than that which is in the hands of the people, and as a result, they then claimed monopoly over the two revealed sources (the Quran and Sunnah) as well after having assumed all rights over interpreting them both and clarifying the rulings within them. On top of making the people’s religion exclusively that which is in accordance with the imams, they bound their worldly matters to them also by propagating the shirk of worship amongst their followers, and encouraging them to appeal for aid by way of their imams and supplicating to them, and to draw closer to them by means of sacrifice and oaths, and to seek blessings from their graves and that which they claim to be from their remnant artifacts, that they might enrich them with money and offspring, or cure them from sickness – as they claimed – and all of that in the framework of a concerted, and comprehensive operation to marshal the people into their camp and fasten them to their madhhab. The points we’ve mentioned with regards to their construction of their entire religion on the foundation of imamah are sufficient and therefore shouldn’t require any more examples to make it clear, bearing in mind that their superstitious, manmade religion is full of the likes of such strange matters. From the Divine Imamah to the Imam’s Deputyship The Rafidah didn’t shy away from changing their religion on the issue of imamah on numerous occasions during the course of approximately two centuries. However, the most embarrassing of stages through which they passed was when their 11th imam, Hasan al-‘Askari Ibn ‘Ali al Hadi, died without leaving a successor, and that was in the middle of the third century after the Hijrah. And in order for their theory to survive, they invented a story about the birth of a son belonging to Hasan al-‘Askari from a Roman slave woman, and they claimed that his mother hid him in order to protect him from the rulers until he grew up. Then, they altered their stor an said that his enemies stumbled upon him when he was a young boy and so he hid himself from them in a tunnel in the city of Samarra in Iraq. When the story of his going into hiding was prolonged, and his followers began to increase in their questioning about his whereabouts, requesting that they see him so that they may take their religion from him, the lying imposters claimed that he had concealed himself from the people and cloaked himself from their sight, and that as such, none would know him except his deputy, ‘Uthman Ibn Sa’id al-‘Umri, who produced for them messages claiming that they were written by the alleged Mahdi to appoint him as his deputy with respect to responding to the people’s questions, conveying to them the knowledge of the imam, and collecting from them the khums – the last being the most important as we will later see. The appearance of a deputy for the 12th imam, Muhammad al-Mahdi Ibn al-Hasan al-‘Askari, marked the end the era of the known imams for the Rafidah, and thus began the era of ghaybah, and this phase was named the minor ghaybah due to the presence of deputies who were known to the imam, and who would take up their position and preserve for the Rafidi tawaghit their false theory and corrupt fundamentals. The phase of the minor ghaybah continued for approximately 70 years, with the consecutive succession of three deputies within that period, the most prominent of them after al-‘Umri was his son Muhammad (and we note that the deputyship of the imam is inherited by one’s son just like the position of imamah), who retained his position for 40 years and was succeeded by Husayn an-Nawbakhti, followed by ‘Ali al-Masiri after that, whose death – in the year 329 AH – ended that phase, especially because with his death they began to feel that the lie of the minor ghaybah and the presence of the imam in a hidden place would no longer fool anyone, given that the number of years equivalent to a typical person’s lifespan had already passed. Then began the phase of the major ghaybah, during which they forbade delving into its true nature or asking about the location of the imam and the appointed time of his appearance. This continued from that time until today, leaving the Rafidah living without a visible imam for over 1000 years. The scholars of the Rafidah then began inventing ahadith and attributing them to their imams, and they began to advance their attempts to escape the labyrinth of ghaybah through numerous resolutions – no doubt the wilayat al-faqih in Rafidi Iran represents their latest phase – and for this reason we find that during this period they increased in narrations mentioning “the era of emergence,” and what they mean by that is the emergence of the awaited Mahdi, that he may establish the just Islamic State and take revenge on the enemies of Ahlul-Bayt (meaning by them, Ahlus-Sunnah), and spread justice on the earth as it once was filled with kufr and tyranny, as they claim. A Thousand Years of Confusion… The Rafidi tawaghit fell victim to their own evil actions, and the trap of divine imamah which they erected for the Muslims. And they found that the chains and cuffs with which they had fettered the people for so long were now shackling their own hands and necks, for the matters which they had confined to the imam – such as legislation, ijtihad, ruling, establishing the hudud, fighting, collecting the khums and the zakah, and other matters – and which they had forbidden any individual from assuming, were now matters which they themselves were also prohibited from undertaking due to the ruling of the absent imam, and the impossibility of him dying and the impossibility of appointing an imam after him now that they had concluded with him their chain of twelve imams, and likewise due to the difficulty of claiming that he has a deputy as a result of the multitudes who would be tempted by the authority of imamah and its financial gains to pursue the position of deputy (and during the period of the four accepted deputies, there had actually appeared 30 deputies whom the Rafidah rejected and who undertook the collection of the khums and the zakah in the name of the absent imam). Here, it was essential for them to come up with a new ploy to keep their Rafidi religion alive and evolve their concept of divine imamah. And as such, the belief of the Rafidah was severely shaken within this period, and most of them left that false religion in which they found many contradictions, due to every aspect of their religion and worldly life being restricted to the presence of the imam who in fact was nothing but a myth and an invented fable. One of the lying tawaghit whom they refer to as “the truthful” described the condition of the Rafidah at the beginning of the period of the major ghaybah – which they refer to as “the era of confusion” – with his statement, “I found most of those who disagree with me from the Shi’ah have become puzzled by ghaybah, and doubt has entered them regarding the affair of al-Qaim (the Shi’ah Mahdi),” while another of their tawaghit, an-Nu’mani, stated, “What confusion could be greater than this one, which has taken all these people out of the affair such that there does not remain from among those who had been upon it except for a tiny amount?! And this is due to the people’s doubt.” The “Tawaqqufiyyin” and the “Harakiyyin” During this period it was essential to develop the theory of divine imamah and invent a new theory known as “intidhar” (the awaiting), whose interpretation was subsequently differed upon, leading to two main stances. The first, the “tawaqqufi” (refraining) trend, is established upon concealing oneself by way of taqiyyah until the absent imam returns. The second, the “haraki” (being active) trend, is established upon the necessity of preparing the existing state of affairs for the return of the imam, and that is achieved through the achievement of consolidation and the acquisition of strength in order to remove the causes of the imam’s fear of his enemies so that he may succeed in emerging, ruling, and establishing the religion. As for the tawaqqufi trend, it emphasized the impermissibility of attempting to establish the Islamic State and the impermissibility of following anyone who emerges in the era of absence in the name of returning the rule of Ahlul-Bayt, and they have ascribed to Muhammad al-Baqir the statement, “If any banner is raised before the banner of the Mahdi, its leader is a taghut that is worshiped besides Allah, and every bay’ah before the appearance of al-Qaim (the Mahdi) is a bay’ah of kufr, hypocrisy, and deceit.” The “ikhbari” manhaj prevailed amongst the followers of this trend, which they falsely liken to the manhaj of Ahlul-Hadith, and which forbids their scholars from ijtihad and forbids their ignorant ones from blind following, and orders them all to take only from the narrations attributed to their imams. And they have gone to extremes in lying against the Prophet g and his family, and even upon their absent Mahdi. One could say that most of what was inserted into the religion of the Rafidah of lies, heresies, myths, and defamation of Islam and its adherents and the Quran and its carriers, was from the actions of those ikhbariyyin. They even rewrote the history of the past generations from anew in accordance with their whims and their beliefs. And as such, the Rafidah – and most significantly among them, the ikhbariyyin – were not content with merely building their religion on the corrupt principle of divine imamah. Rather, they rewrote the history of mankind anew so that it would coincide with this false theory, and even specified guideposts for the future so that the future would also coincide with it. On this basis, those belonging to the tawaqqufi trend maintained a negative position towards every state which the Rafidah established in prior eras, and denied the validity of these states based on the theories of wasiyyah, nass, infallibility, and intidhar, as well as other conditions which were not met by any of those rulers despite their adherence to the religion of the Rafidah, and their belief in the awaiting of the Mahdi, and despite the factors by which they justified the absence of their imam being removed when some of those kings asked the Rafidi tawaghit to request of the Mahdi that he emerge so that he can take control of their states. They refused this, however, on the pretext that his emergence would be accompanied by signs which had not yet appeared! As for those adhering to the other trend, those to whom the rigidity of intidhar did not appeal to, despite their belief that there could be no imam except with the emergence of their Mahdi, in conformity with their faith in the theory of divine imamah and its false conditions, they were greatly troubled by the weakness of their innovated theories and their superstitious stories in the face of their opponents’ arguments. So they set out, due to pressure from their followers, to free themselves from the rigidity of intidhar, arming themselves with the misguided intellectual manhaj of the Mu’tazilah and the principles they followed in acquiring knowledge, exercising ijtihad, and debating, so that these Rafidi tawaghit – whom they refer to as the usuliyyin – could thereby slowly open for themselves the door to exercising ijtihad, gathering followers, and resuming the application of some of the forms of worship which were suspended by the tawaqqufiyyin in the era of ghaybah, such as the Jumu’ah prayer, hisbah, fighting, the establishment of the hudud, and even leadership, and all of that – of course – according to the religion of the Rafidah, not according to the religion of Islam. The Theory of “Niyabat al-Faqih” (Deputyship of the Jurist) The tawaghit of the usuliyyin succeeded in opening for themselves the door of ijtihad by breaking the lock of divine imamah which had shut the door on them, and by unbinding the knot created by the tawaghit of the ikhbariyyin, which was related to the notion that any knowledge other than the knowledge of the prophets and the imams was merely presumed knowledge, and their prohibition of working in accordance with such knowledge. So they produced a new theory built on the principle of “the jurists’ general deputyship” on behalf of the Mahdi, based on the explanation of a text attributed to one of their imams in which he permits obedience to the one who knows the their traditions. As such, they are the deputies of the Mahdi in this regard and no more, and he (meaning the Mahdi) guides them and prevents them from mistakes, based on the Mu’tazili theory of “lutf,” and even appears at times of necessity to nullify the consensus they have upon a mistake through a statement which he casts among their statements, whether attributing it to a known or unknown individual. Except that for the most part with respect to the principles laid down concerning the theory of niyabat al-faqih, they were established to resolve the problem of collecting the khums tax through which they made it obligatory to deduct one-fifth of their wealth and give it to the imam, after the practice of collecting it had been halted for a long period of time due to the absence of the imam. As such, there remained nothing before the tawaghit of the Rafidah other than to open the door for themselves to take this money from the people under the claim of preserving it in their treasuries and turning it over to their Mahdi when he appears, or to act on his behalf in utilizing it and spending it on Ahlul-Bayt, as the claimed, and for the cause of propagating their religion and strengthening their followers. So when the door to acting on behalf of the absent imam had been opened concerning one issue – the issue of the khums – the Rafidi tawaghit then permitted for themselves step-by-step to act on his behalf on all other matters, to the extent that one of the pioneers of this trend, their shaykh, al-Karaki, stated, “The trustworthy jurist who fulfills all the conditions for issuing fatawa is appointed by Imam Mahdi.” As such, the Rafidi tawaghit began to assume the position of their imams and imitate them more and more, and to monopolize for themselves what was exclusive to them, including legislation, ijtihad, judgment, and leadership. They began to exploit the theory of the deputyship of the jurists in order to pressure the leaders into allowing them to rule, and if they did not, they would be mushrik tawaghit. In doing so, they resembled what the popes of the Christians used to do during their period of weakness, whereby they would stipulate their approval for the legitimacy of the rule of the kings of Europe, claiming that they were the deputies of ‘Isa the Messiah  in that regard. From Niyabat al-Faqih to Wilayat al-Faqih… The Safawi state is perhaps the first of the Rafidi states in which the Rafidi tawaghit exercised their authority as deputies of the alleged Mahdi, whereby Tahmasib Ibn Isma’il as-Safawi gave the reign to one of them – al-Karaki – to rule as deputy to the Mahdi, on the basis that al-Karaki would give him his approval to manage the affairs of the land of Persia. He would thereby acquire legitimacy in the eyes of the Rafidah, whom he sought to conciliate and bring into his ranks against his Ottoman enemies in particular, and likewise acquire legitimacy in the eyes of his soldiers and supporters from among the Qizilbashi Batini Sufis. However, the stipulation that the Mahdi’s deputies approve of the leaders wasn’t firmly established as a law, firstly due to the kings evading the issue, and due to the dispute surrounding the origin of the theory of niyabat al-faqih with the ikhbariyyin, who had never submitted to their brothers the usuliyyin, and who never accepted their appointment on the part of their Mahdi. And despite that, the influence of the Rafidi tawaghit continued to increase among their followers, and as a result, they acquired powers with which they were able to place pressure on the rulers, as they had done previously with the rulers of the Qajari dynasty until the end of their reign. And due to the turbulent relationship between them and the rulers, there appeared among the Rafidi tawaghit a strong trend which declared that the authority must be directly in their hands, and that they would subsequently delegate part of it to whom they deemed fit from among the people, as opposed to dividing it with the rulers such that they are not left with authority over anything other than religious affairs. And thus it was, and after the Rafidah and their tawaghit experienced trouble due to the theory of divine imamah and its conditions, and the theories of ghaybah and intidhar, they began to openly declare in a softened voice the necessity of reviewing these false theories, or at the very least the creation of some avenues that would permit for them the establishment of states and governments, grant them the final decision on cases and matters of dispute, and give them authority over the guarding of their battle fronts, the implementation of the hudud, the collection of the khums and the zakah, and other such matters which their societies could not do without. So there took shape with them a new theory – the theory of wilayat al-faqih – upon which they built what will be the last of their taghut states, by Allah’s permission, this being the shirki state of Iran, which the Islamic State is waging war against today. And we shall seek – by Allah’s permission – in the next part of this series to speak about this theory and its reality today in the shade of its implementation at the hands of the tawaghit of Iran. We ask Allah to teach us of that which benefits us, and to allow us to benefit from that which we have learned, and to guide us to the sound way. And all praise is due to Allah, Lord of the creation.
