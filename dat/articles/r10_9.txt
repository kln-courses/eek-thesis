The nationalist Taliban movement repeatedly strove to reassure the mushrikin in the nations surrounding Afghanistan by declaring their respect for their kafir systems of rule and their devotion to friendly relations with them. But this only earned them further hostility and support for their enemies due to their superficial application of parts of the Shari’ah, their harboring of muhajirin, and their allowing the mujahidin to use their lands as a safe haven and for preparation. The movement was then hit by a major setback when it lost its foothold after just a few days of Crusader bombardment and became broken up for a long time after the Taliban abandoned their amir and forsook him during that difficult period, which led to his isolation prior to his death. Thereafter, new centers of power took shape within the movement, and the reins of power were taken with support and direction from Pakistani Intelligence. This murtadd faction in whose hands was the portfolio for external relations since the movements’ seizure of Kabul – and which was in charge of every flattering address directed towards the mushrikin and murtaddin in the neighboring countries – increased in their allegiance to the kuffar after they took control of the entire affair, and they began to offer themselves to them as a humble servant and a watch dog guarding their borders and their lands by constantly reaffirming that they do permit the mujahidin to prepare new attacks against them that are launched from the areas that they control, and this was in exchange for attaining the mushrikin’s recognition, their acceptance in establishing relations with them, and their contribution of some support to them. And with the announcement of the Islamic State and the return of the rule of the Khilafah on the earth, and the rebuilding of the jama’ah of the Muslims, and the endeavor to establish the shari’ah of Allah on the entire earth, the murtadd nationalist Taliban movement shared with the Crusader nations and the tawaghit who rule the lands of the Muslims their fear of the spread of the call to tawhid among the people, as well as its implications, including the obligation of disavowal from shirk and its people, showing hostility to them, and fighting them until the religion is entirely for Allah, and likewise what it implied of loyalty to the people of Islam, and the obligation of their adhering to the jama’ah of the Muslims, and breaking the artificial borders that are tearing apart and separating the Muslim lands, and the disbandment of organizations and factions who divide the Muslims into groups and parties. Fighting the Islamic State ultimately became a joint project between the Taliban movement and the nations of kufr, who were terrified by the presence of the Islamic State on their borders, just as its presence terrified the United States of America, which occupies Afghanistan. The murtaddin of the Taliban then began to present fighting the Islamic State as an expensive commodity which every one of the states sought to purchase, and the price demanded in exchange was the commencement of relations with the Taliban’s officials, and their securing of political support, and possibly financial support and weapons. Due to that it was not surprising that the Crusader Russians justified their open relations with the murtadd Taliban movement under the pretext that they are aimed at fighting the Islamic State, displaying their fear of the spread of its soldiers in the vicinity of Russian interests in the region of Central Asia, while displaying at the same time their preparedness to enter militarily into a fight with the soldiers of the Khilafah in Khurasan Wilayah. What concerns Russia – without doubt – is distancing the Americans from their border, and from their interests in the region of Central Asia, but that is without the withdrawal of America leading to the Islamic State taking its place, and sharing with them in that goal are China and Iran. They therefore seek to fill the vacuum that emerges in the case of the American withdrawal, whether that is through a direct presence – and that is difficult and expensive – or by turning Khurasan into a safe zone which its allies oversee in order to prevent their enemies from having a presence in what they consider a dangerous region. The nationalist Taliban movement represents an ideal model as that ally, due to its ambitions being confined to a nationalist Afghanistan, and due to its tribal and madhhabi fanaticism, and its strong relationship with the Rafidi government of Iran, the closest ally to Russia in these days. Indeed, this murtadd movement, with its proposal to fight the Islamic State on behalf of the Crusader nations and tawaghit governments, is merely repeating what many other organizations and factions falsely claiming Islam had done before them, such as the Sahwah factions of Iraq, and their likes from the Sahwat of Sham and Libya, which the al-Qa’idah organization – who have bay’ah to the nationalist Taliban movement – are allied to. The fate of this murtadd movement, which many were deceived by, won’t differ from the fate of the Sahwat of Iraq and Sham, by Allah’s permission, and their allies will search for a replacement for them once they discover their inability to prevent the soldiers of the Khilafah from reaching them and striking them in their lands. Rather, they will discover their inability to protect even themselves, and their need for their protection. So let the soldiers of the Khilafah in Khurasan complete what they have begun by fighting the Crusaders and murtaddin, and let them intensify their punishment of all the enemies of Allah – as is their custom – and let them support Allah with their words and deeds, for neither mankind nor the Jinn shall triumph over them even if they were to unite against them. And victory is not except from Allah, the Exalted in Might, the Wise.
