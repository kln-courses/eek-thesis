The Rafidah entered into the battle of Mosul parading their armored vehicles and heavy tanks in long convoys – one barely able to see where they end – and they promised their Crusader allies that they would end the battle in a matter of days. And here there have passed us – by Allah’s grace – eight months of fierce battles, and so the convoys of the Rafidah were annihilated at the hands of the resilient soldiers of the Khilafah guarding the fronts, and their battalions and brigades were vanquished, and those of them who flee from the battle are chastised by their Crusader masters through aerial bombardment and killing, and yet the mushrikin continue to promise their allies that the battle will be ended in but a matter of days. May Allah reward the mujahidin of Mosul – the leaders and soldiers alike – on behalf of Islam and the Muslims with every good, for they have entered into one of the hardest and largest battles in history, and presented for the entire world an example of steadfastness that is difficult to find in this time of ours. They neither accepted disgrace in their religion, nor did they surrender to their enemy, and they did not retreat from a piece of land except that they filled it with the torn limbs of the mushrikin and their blood, in order that they may not rejoice over their advances, nor celebrate an easy victory. And thus is the way of the people of tawhid everywhere, and the stories of their steadfastness and heroism in fighting are nothing strange. Here are the epic battles of Sirte, Fallujah, Bab, and other than them from among their timeless battles, bearing witness to the truthfulness of their words, and the goodness of their deeds. “And whoever is an ally of Allah and His Messenger and those who have believed - indeed, the party of Allah - they will be the predominant” (Al-Maidah 56). And today is the day for the people of tawhid and the soldiers of the Khilafah in the city of Raqqah to compete with their brothers in pursuing the pleasure of the Lord of the creation, and in pursuit of the highest degrees of Jannah, whereby they cling tightly to their posts with their molars, and sacrifice their lives for the cause of their religion, remaining true to what they promised Allah, each one of them declaring in his position: Allah  shall see what I do today. And so they confront their enemies on the frontlines, not turning their faces away during the confrontation, until they meet their Lord, for He  has laughed and is pleased with them. For the murtaddin have come to them with fear and apprehension, as they know for certain that this battle is not like any other battle that has preceded it and in which they engaged with the soldiers of the Khilafah, and because of this they prepared for it that which they had not prepared for previous instances, and they mustered for it soldiers the likes of which they had never done before, and the Crusaders presented them with support the likes of which they had never done before, and the Crusader leadership still continue to remind them that this battle will not be easy, and that it won’t be ended any time soon, preparing them mentally to continue forward regardless of whatever losses are incurred and however long it takes. However, the Crusaders and their murtadd allies know with certainty that there is not an army in the world that is able to continue in a battle whose losses are greater than its ability to compensate, and whose duration is longer than its strength to hold out and persist, and if that weren’t the case, the Crusader American army wouldn’t have felt compelled to retreat, leaving Iraq defeated and expelled after what it encountered at the hands of the mujahidin, and due to what its leaders recognized of the huge magnitude of exhaustion that had afflicted it, and which began to threaten their entire country, through its economy which was struck by the crisis, and its prestige which had reached rock bottom, and its strategy which was forced to be changed due to its high costs. From the greatest causes of fear that the Crusaders and their murtadd allies have is that they know very well the size of their forces, and they realize that the PKK and their small numbers, and the burdensome expenses on the Crusader treasury involved in arming them, and their murtadd soldiers whom they apprehend from the streets and after some poor training hurl them into the battle fronts, are not capable – by Allah’s permission – of enduring a severe battle similar to Mosul, nor are they capable of enduring a minute portion of the burdensome expenses which the Rafidah have endured throughout that battle, nor do they possess the great inherent strength required to assist them in replenishing those lost, or reinforcing those present, for we have seen how they were in the battle of Manbij and how they complained of collapse after only two months of battle, except that Allah accomplished a matter already destined. What is obligatory upon every mujahid in the city of Raqqah, wherever he is stationed, is to place in his calculations that this battle be a front for annihilating the murtaddin, a recompense for their disbelief in Allah the AlMighty, and their waging war against His religion, and a final payment of a lengthy bill with them, for there is no end to this battle except that one of us will annihilate the other. Either we will exterminate them by Allah’s might and strength – such that they lose in this world and in the Hereafter – or die trying, so that we would meet Allah having remained steadfast upon His religion, fighting his enemies, and succeed as the companions of the ditch succeeded, and profit in the abode of the Hereafter – the abode of eternity – with no third option between us and them. And Allah will surely support those who support Him. Indeed, Allah is Powerful and Exalted in Might.
