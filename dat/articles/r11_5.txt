In the last three parts of this series we covered the development of the religion of the mushrik Twelver Rafidah and how their religion was built entirely on the corrupt principle of “the divine imamah,” which confines the right of leadership to a group of people whom they claim deserve it due to a covenant from Allah  and due to inheriting their authority from the Prophet g. We discovered how they added to and subtracted from their religion over the course of the past centuries, due to the wavering nature of their religion’s foundation and their constant need to reinforce it with more lies and superstitions, which did not end when they invented a personality whom they claim to have been born to a man who in reality did not have any children and then invented for him the story of his absence. They then connected his tale with the story of ‘Abdullah al-Mahdi whom the Muslims will appoint over their affairs at the end of times, and who will lead them in fighting the Dajjal and the mushrikin with him. In this part of the series in which we conclude our discussion of the Twelver Rafidi experiment to establish a so-called Islamic State, we will endeavor to complete the story of the development of the religion of these people, and will arrive at the most recent of the lies and deceptions put forth by their tawaghit, this being the theory of “wilayat al-faqih,” which the political system of the Rafidi state of Iran is based on today, and which the Rafidah endeavor to spread so that it encompasses every land they are able to take control of. The End of the Path of Misguidance… An Abyss The predecessors of the tawaghit of the Rafidah put forth the theory of the divine imamah as a means of subverting the imams of their time, and to gather followers and supporters by convincing them that the Islamic State could not be established the way it was in its first era except if it were led by men from the household of the Prophet g, whom they regard as the trustees of the prophetic methodology, the inheritors of the knowledge of the prophets, and the ones who are alone eligible to have the people follow them due to alleged characteristics they had given them, such as infallibility, the knowledge of the unseen, and other than that. And when they deemed anyone who rules the people, judges between them, issues religious fatawa for them, or implements the rites of the religion among them – such as the congregational prayer, the zakah, jihad, and other than that – as being a taghut, unless it was their imams or those whom their imams had appointed to carry out these duties, it became a trap which they had created for themselves due to their line of imams being cut off and their imams completely disappearing from the earth. This was because it meant – based on their corrupt principle – that the people had to remain without a jama’ah, and without an imam who they could rally behind, pray behind, and fight their enemies behind, and without a judge who would settle their disputes, all this in addition to the rulings of the Shari’ah being suspended and the people submitting to the rulings of the tawaghit, and in addition to the rites of the religion being abolished and its symbols ceasing to exist. And all this so that there would come about the conditions which they claim are necessary for the emergence of their absent, fabricated imam in order to rule them, lead them, and govern them with justice, and rule them with the Shari’ah. From the Leadership of an Infallible Person to Wilayat al-Faqih Generation after generation, the tawaghit of the Rafidah would endeavor to free themselves of the shackles which they had placed on their own necks and the fetters with which they had bound their own hands and feet, and would endeavor to come out of the trap which they had dug themselves into. So they began to work on justifying their fulfillment of the roles which they had previously confined to their absent imam, beginning with issuing fatawa, judging, collecting the khums, and overseeing the awqaf (endowments) and the wealth of the orphans, until they eventually made the claim that they had the right to rule the people as deputies of the imam, and claimed that they had taken that right with regards to all of that from the absent imam, either through letters falsely attributed to him, or narrations falsely attributed to their previous imams. And as such, the affair of the tawaghit of the Rafidah reached a point where they appointed themselves as trustees to their kings, and based on that, took charge of the affairs of rule and governance as deputies of the imam with the authority they claimed to have taken from their imams, as had been the case with the popes of the Christians with the kings of Europe centuries ago. So if they accepted anyone, they declared his state to be an Islamic State and permitted their followers to fight behind him and to likewise seek judgment from him, while at the same time maintaining a monopoly on the wealth of the khums as deputies of the imam. And if they rejected the rule of any king, they declared him to be a taghut and incited their followers to disobey him and overthrow him. And when the disputes between the evil scholars whom the Rafidah follow and their kings grew worse, each side began plotting against the other and began striving to gain a monopoly so they could rule without the other. So there emerged among the scholars of the Rafidah individuals who openly declared that it was obligatory for the rule to be in their hands alone, and they thereby developed the theory of the divine imamah through which they claimed the right of their imams to take charge of the affair of the Muslims, so they could then transfer this right to themselves as they had done with all the other affairs that had initially been specific to their imams and which they then permitted for themselves. And so there emerged the theory of wilayat al-faqih, which in reality is a means of discreetly revolting against the foundation of their false religion by taking all the authority which they had confined to their alleged imams and granting it to men who do not possess the characteristics which they had previously claimed were mandatory for the ruler to have, so that he would be just and would establish the religion upon the prophetic methodology, with the most important of these characteristics being that he be immune from making mistakes, and that he have knowledge of all things, whether open or hidden, present or absent. They were able to overlook these characteristics by modifying them and reducing them to a certain degree so that they would suit them. So in place of their stipulation that the ruler be immune from making mistakes, they sufficed with the condition that he be outwardly just, and in place of their stipulation that he have knowledge of all things, they sufficed with the condition that he have the knowledge required in order to rule with their shari’ah, meaning that he be knowledgeable of the statements of their imams, and is capable of exercising ijtihad with their statements and taking religious rulings from them. They even dared to seek for themselves the position of “successor to the imam” in place of what they had previously sufficed with of the position of “deputy to the imam.” They then came to what they had previously rejected of Ahlus-Sunnah’s rulings related to imamah – the foundation of which is succeeding the Prophet g in leading his ummah and governing them with the shari’ah of the Lord of the creation – so that they could take these rulings and clarify with them this theory of wilayat al-faqih along with what they added to them of heresies and of the opinions of their brothers, the Mu’tazilah, who are falsely associated with Ahlus-Sunnah concerning this matter. The Rafidah Nullify the Foundations of Their Religion The tawaghit of the Rafidah went back and affirmed that a state becomes Islamic when it is ruled by the shari’ah of Islam, and that because the reason for its establishment is to establish the religion, it was obligatory to appoint a ruler who would establish this religion and rule by this shari’ah, keeping in mind their belief that the religion which was obligatory for this government to establish was their false, manmade religion, and that the shari’ah that was obligatory for it to rule by was their taghut shari’ah, which is based on taking their scholars as lords besides Allah . Likewise, they affirmed that appointing this imam could only be done by selecting him, not through a nass or through authority inherited from the prophet. As such, it was permissible for whoever fulfilled the conditions of the khalifah to become the ruler. In fact, that would be obligatory upon him, and it would be obligatory upon those who were capable of selecting him to select him, so that he would establish their religion and rule by their shari’ah, and so that this ruler would be a “guardian over [the affairs of] the believers” and a successor to the imam who would assume his position and take up the rights he had over all those who believed in that absent imam. Thus, they were forced to eradicate their creed of “waiting” through their admission that “the Islamic State could not be established except by the believers endeavoring to establish it,” and as a result, they were likewise forced to denounce those who called for the people to sit back and wait for the return of the imam so that he could establish the just state which could not be established by anyone else, and who forbade any actions taken to hasten this to occur, and who even considered any banner that emerged in order to establish this state before the return of their imam as being a banner of Jahiliyyah and those who raised such banners as being devils. So as long as the “Islamic government” could be established in the absence of the “infallible imam,” it was even more appropriate to permit – and even make it obligatory – that the people come out and be active in order to establish this government. From the “Major Absence”… to a Total Absence And so we find the main taghut of the Rafidah, Khomeini, affirming in his famous book, “al-Hukumat al-Islamiyyah,” the evil effects of the heresies they introduced and through which they thought they would reach a position to rule the people with their shari’ah. The dead Khomeini states, “More than 1000 years have passed since the major absence of our imam, the Mahdi, and thousands more may pass before the situation may require the coming of the awaited imam, so will the rulings of Islam remain suspended throughout these long years?” He also states, “Do not say, ‘We will leave off [the rulings] until the emergence of al Hujjah (the Mahdi), peace be upon him, for [in that case], why don’t you leave off the prayer as you continue waiting for al-Hujjah?!” He then goes on to affirm the obligation of establishing the Islamic State for the sake of establishing the rulings of the religion. He states, “Everyone who argues the opinion that it is not necessary to form an Islamic government is rejecting the necessity of applying the rulings of Islam and is calling to the freezing and suspension of these rulings. Khomeini moves beyond the Rafidah’s obligating of the presence of the imam in every era and place and instead obligates the presence of a governing authority, as he considers that what is obligatory to be present is leadership itself. He states, “The presence of a governing authority who assumes leadership over the system and the implementation of the Islamic laws is necessary, because he prevents oppression, transgression, and corruption, bears the trust, guides the people to the path of truth, and abolishes the heresies of the deviants and the obstinate. Wasn’t the Khilafah of Amirul-Muminin (he means ‘Ali ) established for that purpose?” And for the purpose of permitting wilayat al-faqih, the taghut, Khomeini, makes the qualification for ruler to be what he has determined of conditions for leadership, and not according to a nass (verbatim appointment), as such conditions cannot be met with the absence of the imam. He states, “Although there is no text that clarifies the characteristics of the one who acts as deputy to the imam during his absence, the characteristics of the ruler are found in any person who is deemed to be qualified to rule the people.” The dead Khomeini even made the act of working towards forming this government an aspect of having iman in wilayah, which is one of the principles of their religion. He states, “Having iman in the necessity of forming this government and creating those institutions is a part of one’s iman in wilayah.” He then emphasizes that the one who leads this government assumes the roles of the imams without acquiring their position or status, “because our words here do not revolve around one’s status or level, but rather, around the functional role,” just as the infallible imam’s assumption of the roles of governance does not reduce him to the level of other rulers, “for indeed, the imam holds a praiseworthy position, a lofty status, and a formative khilafah to whose leadership every atom of the universe submits, and that from the necessary aspects of our madhhab is that our imams hold a position that cannot be attained by a king, nor by a prophet.” And with this, the tawaghit of the Rafidah left for their imams that by which they ascribe them as partners with Allah  in His names and attributes, in calling upon them, and in seeking to attain nearness to them through acts of obedience, and they removed from them some of what they had claimed for them of the right to legislate and rule. So those whom they refer to as “fuqaha” (jurists) hold within their hands the affair of legislation in the name of ijtihad, and it is upon the followers to obey them in that, due to them being the deputies of the imam. And when these tawaghit assumed the position of ruling over the people directly and implementing their laws on them, the need for the absent imam completely ceased to exist. And as long as it was possible to establish their false religion, implement their manmade shari’ah, rob the people of their wealth in the name of “khums,” and fight their enemies in the name of “jihad,” all in the absence of the imam, what then would be the need for the return or emergence of the imam if there were no difference between him being present or absent? Based on this, the Rafidah today are divided concerning the theory of wilayat al-faqih, with one camp supporting it and viewing it as an obligation, and another camp opposing it and continuing to insist on the theory of intidhar (waiting), and deeming it forbidden to establish any states before the return of their imam from his absence, and yet another camp accepting it on the basis that it will pave the way for the return and emergence of their imam by bringing about the right conditions through the increase of his supporters, the preparation of military equipment, and the increase of their strength – all of which would remove the absent imam’s fear of his enemies – and even by deeming those states that function on the basis of wilayat al-faqih as being a means of spreading corruption in the land, so that the earth would be filled with injustice and turmoil, and this would become a cause for the emergence of the imam so that he could fill it with justice and security. However, the voices of those who back wilayat al-faqih are the loudest today, due to their grip on the reigns of authority and the state, and their possession of extensive human and financial capabilities through what they control of Iran’s resources and what they’ve seized of the resources of Iraq and other countries. What Comes After Wilayat al-Faqih The scholars of the Rafidah who believe in wilayat al-faqih have restricted to themselves that which they had previously restricted to their imams, and they did so based on their understanding of the narration which states, “The scholars are the inheritors of the prophets,” a statement which they attribute to Ja’far as-Sadiq . The dead Khomeini stated, “And if we were to look to the statement of Allah , ‘The Prophet is more worthy of the believers than themselves’ (Al Ahzab 6), and ponder his (i.e. Ja’far as-Sadiq) statement, ‘The scholars are the inheritors of the prophets,’ we would come to know that leadership is from the titular affairs which can be transferred, and this is not traditionally impossible.” He also states, “‘Hujjah of Allah’ means that the imam is the people’s point of reference in all their affairs, and Allah has designated him and granted him authority over all the affairs which bring benefit and happiness to the people, and likewise are the jurists, for they are the points of reference and leaders of the Ummah.” And they considered themselves as having been appointed by their imams to judge between the people, and as such, the iman of their followers in the leadership of these jurists over them was an aspect of their iman in the leadership of their “infallible” imams. Khomeini mentions a narration from Ja’far as-Sadiq which states, “Make as a judge between you a man who knows our halal and haram, for indeed I have appointed him over you as a judge.” After mentioning this narration he states, “Based on what this narration necessitates, the scholars have been appointed by the imam to govern and judge between the people, and their position continues to be safeguarded for them.” With that, they considered that if Ahl al-Hall wal- ‘Aqd (those who appoint and remove the ruler) selected an individual who was qualified to rule (because he possessed the two conditions they considered to be fundamental, the conditions of being just and having juristic knowledge), it was on the same level as a nass, which they previously made to be a condition for imamah or for being the deputy to the imam. Through the sum total of what we’ve mentioned, it becomes clear that the Rafidah today, with their application of the theory of divine imamah – upon which their religion is established – and other principles and theories that branch from it, greatly resemble the mushrikin of the Arabs who would craft idols with their own hands out of dates in order to worship them besides Allah, and would then eat them when they became hungry. As such, the tawaghit of the Rafidah gradually did away with their principles and theories, due to the benefits they found elsewhere, after having initially taken them for centuries as idols which they worshiped and a basis for wala and bara, over which they either established ties of affection or declared enmity. The Path of those Who Are Guided… Not the Straying of the Misguided This is how the religion of the Rafidah developed over the course of the past centuries, leading to them affirming the correctness of what that over which they abandoned the jama’ah of the Muslims – their denunciation of the legitimacy of the leadership of the rightly guided khulafa due to the Muslims having selected them, and their claim that a divine text (nass) and prophetic will (wasiyyah) were obligatory for anyone who deserved leadership over the affair of the Muslims. This was so that they could restrict it to ‘Ali  and his sons after him based on what they claimed for them of a nass and wasiyyah, and thereby reject the leadership of all those who assumed leadership over the affair of the Muslims, declare their enmity towards them and fight them, add to their religion, introduce many heresies therein, and go to extremes in fabricating lies against Allah , His Messenger, and the Messenger’s household, all in order to aid their religion and isolate their madhhab from the religion of the Muslims, to the extent that it became an independent religion established upon shirk and superstition, which they had no narrations they could depend on in order to follow it and no intellect that they could depend on in order to take from it. This is how all false madhhabs and misguided groups develop, which claim that they are striving to establish the Islamic State and which proceed upon heretical paths for which they have no evidence or narrations from the righteous Salaf. These heretical paths thus lead them away from the correct path and cast them into the chasms of shirk and kufr even though they claim to want to establish the religion. So they stumble into these chasms as if they were blind and they change their colors as if they were chameleons, to the extent that you would not know of any principle which they use as their foundation. And if they were to agree with some aspect of the truth in some of their statements and deeds, they would not intend by it except that which they intended with any of the paths of misguidance which they had previously followed. So if they were to find within that truth something which they crave, they would cling to it, and if they were to find something other than that, they would criticize it and go back to tossing about in their confusion, searching for guidance on the paths of deviance. As for Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jama’ah, who proceed upon the prophetic methodology in their endeavor to establish the religion, they are upon one path which they have not left since their prophet g was sent and until Allah inherits the earth and all those upon it. They were not confused by the various paths, and did not follow any deviant roads. Rather, they cling to the straight path of Allah, which is His Book and the sunnah of His Prophet g, and they hold firmly to the strong rope of Allah, which is the Jama’ah of the Muslims. They believe in Allah in truth, place their trust in him truthfully, and wage jihad in His path sincerely, and Allah guides them upon the straight path.
